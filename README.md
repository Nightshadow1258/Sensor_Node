# Sensor Node Version 3.50
This is an intermediate version before I decided to move to a two part design.
I split the MCU Board into its own small form factor PCB with connectors on the bottom side to connect to a base board. The inspiration comes from the raspberry compute module. This will allow me to reuse the MCU for different design in the future.

## Components
- NRF52840 (MCU)
- NPM1300 (PMIC)
- BQ29700 (Battery Protection IC)
- SHT40 (Temp & Humidity Sensor)
- USB (charging & data transfer)
